## Measuring something that can't practically be measured

Suppose you want to measure the proportion of the Earth's surface that is water. How would you go about it, practically? Maybe you couldâ€¦

- pour the water off into a large measuring cylinder. But there isn't a container big enough.
- take some time out of your studies and walk around the globe with a tape measure to find the cumulative distance around the edge of all the oceans, then calculate the area. **But you can't measure the length of a coastline**. Due to the [Coastline Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox), coastlines have no well-defined length.

So, if we can't find a way to absolutely, precisely measure it, we must instead _estimate_ the proportion of the Earth's surface that is water.

## It's an analogy

This situation is not really that far removed from making an experimental measurement. 

There may be a value you'd like to measure accurately, like the concentration of a drug in a patient's blood. But how exact can your measurement really be?

- Is the concentration of the drug uniform throughout the bloodstream?
- Does the way you process the sample make any change, however small, to the concentration?
- Is the machine you use to measure the concentration accurately calibrated and absolutely precise?
- Are you considering concentration in one patient, or several patients? How much does variation from patient to patient matter?

There are many influences on experimental measurements that can mean they are, in fact, _estimates_, rather than the true value we hope to measure.
