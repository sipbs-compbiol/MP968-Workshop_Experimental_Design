# Assign Experimental Units {#sec-group-assignment}

Assignment of individuals to appropriate groups is an essential part of experimental design. The NC3Rs EDA provides two nodes to help us describe how this assignment is performed in an experiment:

- **Group**, which describes a group of individuals
- **Allocation**, which describes how individuals are taken from one group, and allocated to another

::: {.callout-note}
For example, if we have an initial pool of all our experimental subjects, this will be one **Group** node. Should we want to assign evert individual from this group to one of two new groups, one receiving the _treatment_ and the other receiving a _control_, then we would need two new **Group** nodes (one for _control_, one for _treatment_), and an **Allocation** node to represent our assignment of individuals from one group to another.
:::

We will carry out this process for our experimental design:

- all individuals initially belong to a single pool
- individuals are assigned from this pool either to a _treatment_ or a _control_ group
- a complete randomisation allocation process is used to assign the subjects to these groups

## Create the experimental subject group structure

### Add the initial pool

1. Click and hold the `Group` node in the sidebar and drag-and-drop it to the canvas (@fig-nc3rs-eda-new-pool). This will represent the complete pool of animals involved in the experiment.

2. Double click on the Group node to change the **label**. Call this Group "Pool Group" (@fig-nc3rs-eda-pool-name)

::: {.column-margin}

### Add an Allocation node

1. The icon panel to the right of the Group node has more options than that for the Experiment node (@fig-nc3rs-eda-group-icons). Move the pointer over the blue circle and then click on it, to link a new _Allocation node_ (@fig-nc3rs-eda-link-alloc).

![The icon panel to the right of the Group node has more options than that for the Experiment node, as more kinds of node can be linked from a Group. ](assets/images/nc3rs-eda-group-icons.png){#fig-nc3rs-eda-group-icons width=80%}

![A new Allocation node, linked to the pool of individuals that will be allocated.](assets/images/nc3rs-eda-link-alloc.png){#fig-nc3rs-eda-link-alloc width=80%}

2. Open the Allocation node properties and set the **label** to read "Complete randomisation", and the **randomisation strategy** (a drop-down) to be "complete randomisation" (@fig-nc3rs-eda-alloc-props). Click on the `Close` button to return to the canvas.

### Add _Treatment_ and _Control_ groups

1. Click the blue square (Group node) icon to the right of the Allocation group **_twice_**, to generate two new Group nodes (@fig-nc3rs-eda-new-groups).

![Two new groups are generated by the randomisation, one for _control_ individuals receiving no drug, and one for the _treatment_ group, who receive the drug.](assets/images/nc3rs-eda-add-new-groups.png){#fig-nc3rs-eda-new-groups width=80%}

2. Click and hold the mouse on each group, and move it until the nodes are positioned separately from each other (@fig-nc3rs-eda-repositioned-groups).

![By clicking on a group and holding the mouse button down, you can move a node into a more aesthetically-pleasing location. ](assets/images/nc3rs-eda-repositioned-groups.png){#fig-nc3rs-eda-repositioned-groups width=80%}

3. Double-click on each new group and name as "Control" and "Treatment" accordingly (@fig-nc3rs-eda-name-groups)

![It can be helpdul for understanding to name each group according to its role in the experiment. Here the two post-randomisation groups are called "Control" and "Treatment".](assets/images/nc3rs-eda-name-groups.png){#fig-nc3rs-eda-name-groups width=80%}

## Summary

By following the process above we have defined our initial pool of experimental subjects, and described how they are randomly assigned to either a _control_ or a _treatment_ group. In the next steps, we will add the nodes that describe our experimental interventions, and the measurements we intend to record.
