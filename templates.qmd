# EDA Templates {#sec-templates}

It can take quite a bit of work to create a new EDA diagram from scratch, especially for complex experiments.

The `Templates` button at the top of the NC3Rs EDA page (@fig-eda-templates-1) links to some template diagrams with common basic experimental designs, that you can customise for your own purposes. Some of these templates are listed below.

## Find a template

1. Click on the `Templates` button (@fig-eda-templates-1)
2. CLick on the `next template` arrow at the top right of the template page until you reach **Template 4**, `Example 4 - Effect of exercise on neuronal density` (@fig-eda-templates-2)

![Each template page shows the starting diagram, and presents a short list of the key features of the template. A written account of the experiment is provided at the bottom of the page, which can be used as a guide when describing your own experiment for funding bodies, and in publication Methods sections.](assets/images/eda-templates-2.png){#fig-eda-templates-2 width=80%}

## Use the template

1. Click on the `Use this diagram as a template` link (on the right of the template page, as in @fig-eda-templates-2)

This opens a new tab in the browser, and populates the design tool with a base starting diagram (@fig-eda-templates-3)
