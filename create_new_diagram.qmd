The sidebar on the left shows a list of _node_ types that can be added to the design. The menu bar at the top allows you to save the experiment in a number of formats, and use tools to carry out analysis of your design.](assets/images/nc3rs-eda-blank-canvas.png){#fig-nc3rs-eda-blank-canvas width=80%}

We can start to build our experimental design by adding an _Experiment node_.
