  title     = "Reporting and misreporting of sex differences in the biological
               sciences",
  author    = "Garcia-Sifuentes, Yesenia and Maney, Donna L",
  abstract  = "As part of an initiative to improve rigor and reproducibility in
               biomedical research, the U.S. National Institutes of Health now
               requires the consideration of sex as a biological variable in
               preclinical studies. This new policy has been interpreted by
               some as a call to compare males and females with each other.
               Researchers testing for sex differences may not be trained to do
               so, however, increasing risk for misinterpretation of results.
               Using a list of recently published articles curated by Woitowich
               et al. (eLife, 2020; 9:e56344), we examined reports of sex
               differences and non-differences across nine biological
               disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the
               147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence
               supporting those differences was often missing. For example,
               when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed,
               authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and
               males responded differently. Thus, sex-specific effects may be
               over-reported. In contrast, we also encountered practices that
               could mask sex differences, such as pooling the sexes without
               first testing for a difference. Our findings support the need
               for continuing efforts to train researchers how to test for and
               report sex differences in order to promote rigor and
               reproducibility in biomedical research.",

  abstract  = "In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a
               statistical test on their difference. In practice, this
               comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving
               two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects
               differ when one effect is significant (P 0.05). We reviewed 513
               behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five
               top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience,
               Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used
               the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An
               additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of
               interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular
               neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous
