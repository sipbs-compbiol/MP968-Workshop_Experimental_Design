  abstract  = "In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a
               statistical test on their difference. In practice, this
               comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving
               two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects
               differ when one effect is significant (P 0.05). We reviewed 513
               behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five
               top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience,
               Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used
               the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An
               additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of
               interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular
               neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous
               procedure is particularly beguiling.",
