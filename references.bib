  title     = "Reporting and misreporting of sex differences in the biological
               sciences",
  author    = "Garcia-Sifuentes, Yesenia and Maney, Donna L",
  abstract  = "As part of an initiative to improve rigor and reproducibility in
               biomedical research, the U.S. National Institutes of Health now
               requires the consideration of sex as a biological variable in
               preclinical studies. This new policy has been interpreted by
               some as a call to compare males and females with each other.
               Researchers testing for sex differences may not be trained to do
               so, however, increasing risk for misinterpretation of results.
               Using a list of recently published articles curated by Woitowich
               et al. (eLife, 2020; 9:e56344), we examined reports of sex
               differences and non-differences across nine biological
               disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the
               147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence
               supporting those differences was often missing. For example,
               when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed,
               authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and
               males responded differently. Thus, sex-specific effects may be
               over-reported. In contrast, we also encountered practices that
               could mask sex differences, such as pooling the sexes without
               first testing for a difference. Our findings support the need
               for continuing efforts to train researchers how to test for and
               report sex differences in order to promote rigor and
               reproducibility in biomedical research.",

@ARTICLE{Karp2021-lc,
  title     = "What is the optimum design for my animal experiment?",
  author    = "Karp, Natasha A and Fry, Derek",
  abstract  = "Within preclinical research, attention has focused on
               experimental design and how current practices can lead to poor
               reproducibility. There are numerous decision points when
               designing experiments. Ethically, when working with animals we
               need to conduct a harm-benefit analysis to ensure the animal use
               is justified for the scientific gain. Experiments should be
               robust, not use more or fewer animals than necessary, and truly
               add to the knowledge base of science. Using case studies to
               explore these decision points, we consider how individual
               experiments can be designed in several different ways. We use
               the Experimental Design Assistant (EDA) graphical summary of
               each experiment to visualise the design differences and then
               consider the strengths and weaknesses of each design. Through
               this format, we explore key and topical experimental design
               issues such as pseudo-replication, blocking, covariates, sex
               bias, inference space, standardisation fallacy and factorial
               designs. There are numerous articles discussing these critical
               issues in the literature, but here we bring together these
               topics and explore them using real-world examples allowing the
               implications of the choice of design to be considered.
               Fundamentally, there is no perfect experiment; choices must be
               made which will have an impact on the conclusions that can be
               drawn. We need to understand the limitations of an experiment's
               design and when we report the experiments, we need to share the
               caveats that inherently exist.",

               two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects
               differ when one effect is significant (P 0.05). We reviewed 513
               behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five
               top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience,

               the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An
               additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of
               interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular
               neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous
