    "text": "Disclaimer\n\n\n\nThe workshop is, effectively, a very short statistics primer for people who would rather not be doing statistics. What I think you’d prefer to be doing is carrying out experiments and researching the effectiveness of drug treatments or formulations, or measuring some kind of effect on complex biological systems.\nI think that what you really want to do is collect data about your system, then connect the data you collect with scientific models (which may or may not be mathematical) that might explain whether your drug is effective, if your new formulation improves drug availability, or some other clever thing with great potential to improve society.\nThe way we connect the data you collect with those scientific models is by using a branch of Applied Mathematics called Statistics. But this workshop is not about “learning Statistics” as a topic. Instead we’ll be thinking about the use of Statistics as a way to understand and process data collected by scientific investigations, and how what we understand about the science - and especially how we express this understanding through the design of our experiments - motivates and guides statistical reasoning.\nThis topic is part of a very large field and discipline but we do not have much time together, so this workshop takes a particular line through the material which tries to illustrate how make statistics serve the science and help you start to develop an intuition about how statistics and experimental design work together, not to teach you statistical methods. The approach we’re taking involves some simulation and analysis using the R language, for the sake of the workshop. It’s very effective and I recommend it, but other statistical approaches, tools, and software that we don’t touch upon at all may be appropriate or necessary for your experiments and their analysis. We do not have time to cover everything here, but there is an additional reading list that you should explore for useful knowledge if your goal is to be a professional scientist.\nAnd, if in doubt, consult a statistician.",

    "text": "Causal inference attempts to put science before statistics, or at least to make statistics work to give us useful scientific outputs. The reason we need something like causal inference is this: the reasons for carrying out a statistical analysis are not present in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reasons for carrying out a statistical analysis are not present in the data\n\n\n\nWhat do we mean by this statement?\nAs an example, consider a statistical question where you have two sets of numbers: {10, 11, 12} and {14, 15, 16}, and you ask: are the averages of these two sets different from each other?\nAs you will recall from your introductory statistics courses, we can always calculate the means and standard deviations of the two sets of numbers, and perform a t-test to calculate a proability that we should reject a null hypothesis of the means being equal. So we can answer the question: “Are the means of these two sets of values statistically different from each other?”.\nBut we’re usually not asking that question in isolation. In an experiment, those numbers represent something in the real world, and in which we’re interested. We want to know what is the scientific insight that is gained? Maybe it’s something like:\n\nthe number of people who vote in an election before and after a bribe is offered\nthe number of mice that survive a condition, after some drug intervention\nreaction times in an individual before and after drinking alcohol\n\nThe point is, we can’t tell what the numbers represent, or what any differences mean, from the data alone! We cannot look at the numbers alone and extract the causes of the data.\n\n“No causes in, no causes out.” - Nancy Cartwright, Cartwright (2011)\n\n\n\nStatistical models are only devices that process data to provide estimates. To understand what the data are telling us, and for statistical analysis to give us scientific insight, we need additional information: scientific (causal) models.\n\n\n\n\nCartwright, Nancy. 2011. “A Philosopher’s View of the Long Road from RCTs to Effectiveness.” Lancet 377 (9775): 1400–1401.",

    "text": "Correlation does not imply causation\n\n\n\nYou will probably have correctly heard phrases like “correlation does not imply causation” in reference to the observation that just because you can identify two values apparently changing together, that doesn’t mean that the change in one value causes the other to change. The relationship might be the reverse of what you think (after all, an association between two sets values could run in either direction - the direction is not evident from the data alone), or it may be pure coincidence. There’s even a whole website dedicated to such spurious correlations.\nIt turns out that causation does not imply correlation either, but this is a complex topic that we don’t have time to get into in a single workshop about experimental design.\nThe statment “correlation does not imply causation” is often used dismissively to demean the role of statistics, but that’s unfair. It is possible to estimate causal effects using statistics, but all of the information about causal relationships comes from the researcher.\n\n\n\n\nThe estimate or prediction of the consequences of an intervention: e.g. if you administer a drug, there is an effect such as reduction in blood glucose concentration. In an experimental context you are often aiming to set up a system where a single intervention of interest (such as administration of a drug) is being made, and the consequences measured.\nThe imputation of a missing observation - where you play “what if?” games by substituting values which you have not directly measured to see what changes in the system might result. You might measure the reduction of blood glucose concentration in response to a drug, and from this be able to calculate the amount of drug that was delivered. In general, this allows us to construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes, where we can imagine an outcome (lower blood glucose by 4mM) and work out what dose of drug to give to achieve it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tangible example\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are aware of, or propose, a causal relationship you are expressing the belief that you can predict the consequences of an intervention.\nFor example, if you look out of the window and see trees swaying, and there is some wind, you know the two are connected because you intuitively understand that the wind is causing the trees to sway, not that the trees are moving and creating the wind.\nBut suppose you were an alien from another planet with no knowledge of the Earth, and simply measured windspeed and tree movement. You would find a correlation, but there would be only a statistical association. There would be nothing in the data itself to tell you which was the cause and which was the effect.\nBut you, a mere Earthling know the causal relationship and the nature of the intervention: wind makes trees sway. If you climbed into the tree and rocked it, you would not generate wind. But if you measured the amount by which a tree sways, you could make an estimate of the prevailing windspeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Your beliefs about the system are the causal model\nThe assumptions and beliefs you have that cause you to consider setting up your experiment are a kind of causal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you believe that reaction times get slower when someone has drunk alcohol, then your causal model is that alcohol consumption causes change in reaction times.\n\n\nYou would design your experiment to enable measurements of alcohol consumption and reaction time to be measured, and you might look to find a statistical association. But if you did find a statistical association, your causal interpretation (e.g. that “reaction time slows with increasing alcohol dose”) would be the result of your beliefs about the experimental system, not a result of simply running statistical analysis on the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Experimental design, causal (statistical) inference, and the (statistical) description of a system all depend on the existence of a well-constructed scientific (causal) model.

In fact there are an infinite number of possible proportions! But that’s a bit much to start with, so let’s build up from a set of smaller possibilities. We’ll begin by pretending that the Earth is a tetrahedron (Figure 7.1)2.\nWe’ll also pretend that each face of this Tetrahedron Earth can either be water or land. So there are five possibilities in total:\n\nAll four faces are land (0% water)\nThree faces are land, one is water (25% water)\nTwo faces are land, two are water (50% water)\nOne face is land, three are water (75% water)\nAll four faces are water (100% water)\n\nand we represent these in Figure 7.2.\n\n\n7.1.2 The most plausible planet (small sample)\nNow suppose that we’ve made the first three observations in our sampling from Chapter 5: L, W, L (Figure 7.3), for two “land” (L) and one “water” (W). We want to calculate how many ways we could have seen this outcome (two L and one W), for each of the possible proportions in Figure 7.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: The first three observations: L, W, L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcomes, with 25% water\n\n\n\nWe’ll demonstrate the way the calculation works for a single possibility: where Tetrahedron Earth has a single “water” face, and three “land” faces. Let’s think about each of the observations in turn:\n\nThe first observation is L. There are three “land” faces, so there are 3 ways this result could have been generated.\nThe second observation is W. There is one “water” face, so there is 1 way this result could have been generated, so there are \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) ways that the first two results (L, W) could have been generated.\nThe third observation is L. There are three “land” faces, so there are 3 ways this result could have been generated. This means that there are \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 9\\) ways that the result sequence L, W, L could have been generated.\n\n\n\nWe can repeat this kind of counting procedure to identify the number of ways the outcome L, W, L could have been produced, for each of our five possibilities (Figure 7.4). When we do so, the 25% water planet can give rise to the data in the greatest number of ways, so is the most plausible explanation of the data, and we should expect that Tetrahedron Earth** has one “water” face, and three “land” faces**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: The number of ways we can obtain the outcome L, W, L for each of the five possibilities of Tetrahedron Earth. There are no ways that an “all-water” or “all-land” Earth could produce this outcome: they are completely inconsistent with the evidence. The 25% water possibility can give rise to the observations in nine ways; the 50% water planet in eight ways; and the 75% water planet in 3 ways. The 25% water planet can give rise to the observations in the greatest number of ways, so is the most plausible explanation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall sample sizes lead to “noisy” estimates\n\n\n\nAlthough we have identified the most likely possibility for Tetrahedron Earth as 25% water because this configuration can generate the data in the greatest number of ways, this is not the whole story.\nWhat really matters is not the largest count, but the relative sizes of the counts. Right now, the 25% water and 50% water planet options have very similar counts. This is due to the small sample size, so there’s not a lot of evidence about which of the two options is most likely.\nThis is a good feature of statistical analysis. We don’t want our analysis to be overconfident with small samples.",

    "text": "7.3 The most probable planet\nIn Statistics we tend to deal with probabilities, and it is useful and usual to convert our evaluation of the most plausible explanations from Figure 7.5 into probabilities, as in Figure 7.6.\nThe probability of an outcome is the proportion of all relevant events that we would expect to have that outcome. For example, a fair coin has two sides: Heads and Tails. There are two possible outcomes, and “Heads” is one of them, so we would expect the outcome “Heads” to occur about \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 = 50\\%\\) of the time. In exactly the same way, we simply take the sum of ways our sample can be produced (which is 1834) and, for each possible planet, divide the number of ways it could generate the sample by that total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: To calculate the probability with which each of the five possible Tetrahedron Earths could have generated the sample data, we divide the number of ways they each could have generated the sample by the total number of ways the sample could have been generated (1834). The 50% water planet has a probability of about 56% of being the actual configuration of the planet, given the possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAnother reason for working with probabilities is that the number of ways we can produce large samples becomes enormous and unwieldy to calculate with. Working with probabilities keeps the work manageable on a computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHaving calculated probabilities for the most likely configuration of Tetrahedron Earth, given the data we collected, it appears that there’s a 56% probability that it has two water faces, and 40% probability that it has three water faces.\nWe are still working with a small sample size, and these two outcomes have similar probabilities.",

It gives us a probability distribution that we then must interpret.\nYou are probably used to interpreting the outputs of t-tests and similar statistical analyses in terms of whether a probability is greater or less than some threshold value. It is important to recognise that this probability comes from a distribution of possibilities as well. The difference here is that we are making that distribution explicit, and not applying a threshold.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Probabilities for Icosahedron Earth\nWe wrote the code above to calculate posterior probabilities in R, and so we can reuse the code to investigate circumstances different to Tetrahedron Earth. Specifically, we are interested to know what happens if we have a “more realistic” (but still highly artificial) model: Icosahedron Earth, with 20 faces that are either “water” or “land”. We can calculate this using the code below.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Calculate posterior probabilities for Icosahedron Earth\ndistn_icosa &lt;- compute_posterior(observations, faces=20)\n\n# Show the Tetrahedron Earth distribution as a histogram\nggplot(distn_icosa, aes(x=proportion, y=probability)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size=10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: A histogram of the probabilities that each possible form of Icosahedron Earth (with 20 faces) could have produced the observed sequence of observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually we can now see that the distribution is much smoother and starts to resemble the parametric probability distributions you might already be familiar with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the distribution\n\n\n\nThe distribution in Figure 8.3 is much more informative than that in Figure 8.2. The overall shape of the probability distribution is clearer, and we can see it looks like a skewed bell shape, with a modal2 value of 0.6, implying that the most likely surface water distribution is 60% of the surface of Icosahedron Earth.\nWe can also see that the bulk of the estimates lie between 0.45 and 0.75, suggesting that the analysis is most confident that the true distribution lies somewhere between these values3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe haven’t increased the number of samples we have taken or values we have observed\nWe have only made our model Earth more representative of the “real” situation of an oblate spheroid Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAlthough the estimate of the most likely value for \\(p\\) has become more precise, the y-axis tells us that the probability of any specific value of \\(p\\) being the “true” value has fallen, and the relative probability of nearby possible values for \\(p\\) is very similar.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 What if we used a larger number of faces?\nWe might think that if we continue to increase the level of detail in our model, we will keep increasing the precision of our estimate. We can see what the distribution would look like for a model Earth with 100 faces, using the code below.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Calculate posterior probabilities for Icosahedron Earth\ndistn_hundo &lt;- compute_posterior(observations, faces=100, round_to=5)\n\n# Show the Tetrahedron Earth distribution as a histogram\nggplot(distn_hundo, aes(x=proportion, y=probability)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size=10)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(0, 1, 0.1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: A histogram of the posterior probabilities, using an Earth with 100 faces.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do see that the estimate of the most likely proportion \\(p\\) is more precise, but the relative probability of nearby values is also very similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen changing the number of faces used to represent the Earth, there is a trade-off between the precision of our estimate of the most likely proportion \\(p\\), and our confidence in that estimate being the most likely proportion.",

Increasing the number of samples moves the predicted most likely value closer to the true value.\nAs we increase the number of samples from 9 to 100, the distribution of our estimate remains centred on \\(p = 0.7\\), but the width of the distribution narrows. Within the distributions, the probability of the most likely estimate also increases: we become more certain about our best estimate(s), and the range of plausible estimates gets smaller.",

    "text": "We sometimes refer to studies as being “low-powered” or “underpowered.” What we mean by this is that the expected effect size is small in relation to the variation (e.g. standard error) of the measurement. Low power in studies might result from any number of reasons, such as the experiment involving too few experimental units (e.g. individual subjects), or from measurements having relatively high variability due to the effect of noisy nuisance variables.\nUnderpowered studies may not give a statistically significant result even when a relatively large effect is found in the experiment. Worse still, because a very large effect may be required to reach statistical significance, any “positive” result (rejecting the null hypothesis) is likely to be a statistical outlier and not reflect the true effect size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEven experienced scientists with many publications and long track records of research funding may never have received any formal training in experimental design or statistics. You will sometimes hear claims being made along the lines of:\n\n“if the effects are large enough to be seen in a small study they must be real large effects”\n\nUnfortunately, this is not true. “Statistically significant” results from underpowered studies are highly likely to be exaggerated, and maybe even suggest that the effect acts in the wrong direction! (Figure 11.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: When effect size is small compared to the standard error of the measurement, statistical power is low, and the study is underpowered. In this figure, the null hypothesis is that there is no effect (orange dashed line). The real effect size of the intervention under study is assumed to be 2% of the size of the control (the purple solid line), and estimates are assumed to have the same standard error as the control experiment. The black curve represents the distribution of possible estimates of effect size as a Normal distribution with \\(\\mu=2\\%, \\sigma=10\\%\\). The shape of the curve shows that statistical significance is unlikely to be achieved (we would need a 19% effect size, with this level of variation) but, if it is achieved, it is misleading, as there is a reasonable chance (39%) that the significant result will be in the wrong direction and, in any case, the magnitude of the effect size will be greatly overestimated.

    "text": "12.2 Practical consequences of statistical power\nConsidering statistical power for an experiment suggests some general approaches to improve our chances, as researchers, of seeing a statistically significant result when there is a real effect of suitable size. It also has implications about what kinds of results we are likely to find in the literature, and how we should interpret them.\n\n12.2.1 It is generally better to double the effect size than to double sample size\nThe standard error of estimation decreases with the square root of sample size 2. So, if we double our sample size we should expect, approximately, a \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.4\\times\\) reduction in standard error. But if we are able to double the effect size then the actual difference we are trying to measure would be \\(2\\times\\) as large, and this will have a greater effect on the power of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to maximise effect size, including:\n\nsetting doses as low as ethically possible in the control group, and as high as ethically possible in the treeatment group.\nchoosing individuals that are especially likely to respond to the treatment\n\n\n\nDesigning an experiment with the aim of increasing effect size can be difficult, and lead to other issues. When drug concentrations are set to extreme values it can make the interpretation of the results when drugs are delivered at more realistic therapeutic levels doubtful. If a highly sensitive set of individuals is used in the experiment, then the results may again not generalise well across the wider population.\nIt is for the researcher to decide and justify whether conclusive effects on a subgroup are preferred to inconclusive but more generalisable results.\n\n\n12.2.2 The Winner’s Curse\nThere is a concept in economics called the “Winner’s Curse” in which the winning bidder of an auction is likely to have overpaid with respect to the value of the item being auctioned.\nFigure 11.1 demonstrates that, by focusing on “statistically significant” results, we generate a systematically biased, overoptimistic picture of the world. In Figure 11.1, we have results corresponding to a study where the true effect size could not realistically be more than 2%, but is estimated with a standard error of 10%. The curve shows the distribution of experimental estimates we would expect, shading in green those areas where the result is at least \\(1.96\\sigma\\) from the null hypothesis, i.e. “statistically significant.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUsing the properties of the Normal distribution we can calculate that 5.4% of the estimates in Figure 11.1 will be considered to be “statistically significant”, and that 39% of those “statistically significant” differences correspond to a reduction in effect - a change in the wrong direction!\n\n\nWe can say, without performing any experiment, that an underpowered study like that in Figure 11.1 has essentially no chance of providing useful information.\n\n\n12.2.3 Published results tend to be positive, and overestimates\nDue to the effects of the “winner’s curse,” and well-intentioned designs that attempt to maximise effect size, it is likely that actual effects of any treatment are smaller in a general population than in any specific study.\nAlso, due to the systematic bias that “positive” (i.e. “statistically significant”) results tend to be published when “negative” (i.e. “not significant”) results are not, publication typically biases towards “statistically significant” results whose measured effect sizes, as seen from the “winner’s curse,” are likely to be larger than would be seen in the general population.\n\n\n\n\nKarp, Natasha A, and Derek Fry. 2021. “What Is the Optimum Design for My Animal Experiment?” BMJ Open Sci. 5 (1): e100126.",

Naturally then, we would want to compare what happens to plasma glucose levels when we intervene with drug A, and when we do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn statistical terms, the presence or absence of drug A is our independent variable or explanatory variable.\nWhether drug A is administered or not is entirely under our control, as experimenters.\n\n\nThere are several ways to structure such a comparison, but this research question naturally suggests the use of two experimental groups: one receiving drug A, and one not. We can assume that the results for these groups are each representative of a much larger population, for which the effect of introducing drug A (or not) follows the shape of a parametrisable statistical distribution, like a Normal distribution.\n\n\n15.2.2 Control vs treatment groups\nUnfortunately, we cannot administer the drug in isolation. Drug A, like most drugs, is carried in a vehicle - a substance expected to be inert in the context of the treatment.\nIt would be possible, but unwise, to assume that we could administer drug A alone to one group of mice, and apply no intervention to the other. We are measuring a physiological response which might be affected by many other processes, including the individual being subject to an injection. It might not be correct to assume that the vehicle is inert, either. So we must follow the same protocol as closely as possible in a control group, where the only difference under our control between control and treatment is the presence or absence of drug A.\nPractically then, in our experiment we use two pharmacological interventions:\n\ninjection of a vehicle (control)\ninjection of a vehicle containing drug A (treatment)\n\nWe assume that any variation between individual vehicle preparations (or the experimental subjects’ responses to them) are effectively “drawn from the same population,” and that both groups experience the same causal influence from the injection process, and the introduction of the vehicle. As a consequence we assume that any observed difference between the groups is the result of either receiving drug A, or not receiving it.\n\n\n15.2.3 Random assignment of individuals to groups\nThe remaining potential causal influence we consider - that due to underlying differences between individuals - is accounted for inour experimental design by randomising subjects into experimental groups (treatment and control, see Chapter 18).\nThis works because we assume that all individuals are “drawn from the same population,” such that each mouse as a random choice from a single pool whose underlying plasma glucose level is distributed according to some kind of regular (potentially parametrisable) statistical distribution. This is usually a reasonable assumption, and implies that the groups are samples from the same larger population, so should have similar properties\nThe important consequence of this is that we can argue that - before we intervene with the experimental treatments - we should expect the underlying plasma distribution levels of our treatment and control groups to be comparable. Any differences in measured outcome should then be expected to derive only from our experimental interventions and, in particular, only from the presence or absence of drug A.",

Our simple design might be a bit more complicated than we think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: Our experimental design isn’t as good as we think it is!\n\n\n\n\nClick on the OK button\nNote the locations and kinds of feedback the Critique tool provided (Figure 20.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: The EDA critique output highlights errors with a red box, warnings with an amber box, and advice with a blue box. There are errors in our Experiment node, in the control and treatment Group nodes, and in our Outcome measure node. There are warnings all over the experimental design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors and Warnings: What should we fix?\n\n\n\nThe EDA Critique tool reports three kinds of issue:\n\nErrors are critical problems with the design that would prevent the tool from being able to decide upon an appropriate statistical analysis, or that would indicate structural problems with the design, such as missing or inappropriate elements, that would compromise the experiment fatally. Errors will block further analysis of the experimental design.\nWarnings are generally about missing information that, while not compromising the experiment to the point that it just won’t work, may result in inappropriate analyses. A typical example of this is when the design does not take experimental subject sex into account, this is raised as a warning. Working with a single sex can be justified (e.g. prostate cancer research, breast cancer research) but in general is not good practice and can compromise the interpretation or applicability of results. Warnings typically highlight where clarification could alter the analysis method or interpretation.\nAdvice labels are similar to warnings in that they highlight ambiguities or areas where unstated decisions might alter the conduct or interpretation of the experiment. They are typically less severe than warnings.\n\nErrors must be fixed for the experimental design to be considered at all usable.

Most of the time in in vivo research the experimental unit is a single animal, but it might in some cases be a group of animals, part of an animal (if you are testing distinct limbs of the same animal, for instance), or the same animal at different periods of time.\nThe sample size of an experiment is the number of experimental units in each group. It is critical for good statistics, and being able to make an appropriate inference from your experiment, that the experimental unit is well defined.\nIn the workshop experiment, we are taking a systemic measurement of blood glucose from each animal at the endpoint of the experiment, so our experimental unit is the animal.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new Experimental unit node, by clicking on the grey lozenge in the Pool Group node’s icon menu (Figure 20.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.6: The grey lozenge icon in the Group node panel creates a new Experimental unit node.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the new node into a clear space, and click on the properties icon to bring up the Node properties pane (Figure 20.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.7: The Experimental unit node field panel\n\n\n\n\nRename the node in the label field as “Animal” and select “animal” from the experimental unit is drop-down (Figure 20.8).

Other terms for the same thing include parameter, predictor, or factor of interest.\nHere, our independent variable of interest is drug A, as we are testing the response of animals in the presence or absence of the drug, and the administration of the drug is under the experimenter’s control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo add an independent variable of interest to our design, we need to introduce two new node types:\n\nAn Independent variable of interest node, which states what the variable itself is (e.g. dosage, surgery, drug)\nTwo Variable category nodes, because our variable is categorical - it is subdivided into two categories: “vehicle only”, and “vehicle + drug”.\n\n\n\n\nDrag an Independent variable of interest node from the sidebar on the left, onto the canvas. Double-click on the node, and rename it as “Drug A” (Figure 20.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.9: A new Independent variable of interest node, renamed as “Drug A”. This represents a variable that describes whether drug A was administered or not.\n\n\n\n\nUse the green lozenge icon in the Drug A Independent variable node you just made to create two Variable category nodes, linked to the independent variable (Figure 20.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.10: Clicking on the green lozenge icon twice creates two new Variable category nodes, which describe the categories that the “Drug A” variable may belong to.\n\n\n\n\nRename the Variable category nodes as “vehicle” and “vehicle + drug” (Figure 20.11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.11: The Variable category nodes are named “vehicle” and “vehicle + drug” to represent the two categories for the “Drug A” variable.\n\n\n\n\nLink the “Drug A” variable to the Analysis node by dragging the arrow icon from the “Drug A” node icon panel onto the Analysis node (Figure 20.12). This adds an arrow to the diagram indicating that “Drug A” is a factor of interest for the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.12: The “Drug A” variable is linked to the Analysis node as a factor of interest.",

Failure to account for sex in experimental design may lead to a study not being funded.\nOf particular importance in animal studies is the requirement for both sexes to be used in experimental design.\nIt is still possible to obtain funding from the MRC for single-sex studies, but only where there is strong justification for doing so.

This includes the requirement for both sexes to be used in the experimental design of grant applications involving animals, and human and animal tissues and cells, unless there is a strong justification for not doing so.\nWe also expect applications to include information about the sex of the animals used in experiments, as well as the sex of studied tissues and cells. If you don’t know the sex of the cells and tissues you use, you should plan to determine it as part of your research.\nUse of both sexes is the default\n\n\n\n\nwhere there are acutely scarce resources (for example, human tissue samples of rare diseases)\nresearch into the mechanisms of purely molecular interactions (for example, when investigating protein-protein interactions)\nsingle-sex mechanisms or diseases (for example, ovarian cancer)\nlogistical or ethical considerations with robust justification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnacceptable justifications\n\n\n\nAttempted justifications for single-sex designs that the MRC considers to be insufficient include:\n\nfemale variability (in most cases)\nprior work was performed in only one sex\na lack of evidence of sex having an effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing no-one tells you\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted in Chapter 20, even experienced scientists with many publications and long track records of research funding may never have received any formal training in experimental design. This can lead to entrenched and outdated ideas being propagated, such as that it is not necessary to use both sexes in an experiment because it was previously shown that there is no effect due to sex 2.\nUltimately, as a researcher you are responsible for the rigour and ethics of your own actions. It is always advisable to consult with funding bodies and specialists in research ethics, rather than trust the word of senior scientists alone.\n\n\n\n\n21.1.1 Common statistical misunderstandings\nIt is still possible to hear scientists argue that they should not use both sexes in their experimental design, because it would double the number of animals required, and this would go against the 3Rs principles. A 2021 study also found:\n\nUsing a list of […] published articles […] we examined reports of sex differences and non-differences across nine biological disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the 147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence supporting those differences was often missing. For example, when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed, authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and males responded differently.\n\nand called for further efforts to “train researchers how to test for and report sex differences in order to promote rigour and reproducibility in biomedical research” (Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney (2021)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another thing no-one tells you\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to experimental design, it is possible that even experienced scientists with many publications and long track records of research funding may never have received any formal training in statistics. 3\nAgain, as a researcher you are responsible for the rigour and ethics of your own actions. It is always advisable to consult with statisticians, rather than trust the word of senior scientists alone.\n\n\n\nChanging the design of an experiment from single-sex to two sexes typically does not require an increase in the number of individuals studied. It can often be achieved by running the same experiment but changing half the animals to the opposite sex (e.g. a study designed with 8 males becomes a study with 4 males and 4 females), and analysing the results using ANOVA instead of a t-test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring sex differences\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason the common misunderstanding that animal numbers need to be doubled arises is because researchers don’t immediately realise that sex can be considered as a blocking factor (also known as a nuisance variable), rather than a main effect of study.\nThis is important because, when we estimate the count of sample size needed by power calculation, we are considering the number of individuals required to establish a result only for main effects. We do not need to power experiments for a statistical difference in nuisance variables. Consequently, if the main effects (independent variables of interest, in EDA) remain the same, the number of individuals required to power the experiment remains the same.\nConsidering sex as a blocking factor in this way is known as “monitoring for a difference in sex.” We do not have differences between sexes as a focus of our study, but we would like to be in a position to notice, if there is a large difference between the sexes.",

Some possible blocking factors might include:\n\nthe cage or room that individuals are housed in (there may be differences between locales that influence outcome)\nthe time of day that measurements are made (animals may be diurnal, and respond differently in the morning and evening)\nthe experimenter or handler’s identity (an inexperienced handler may cause stress in animals, and an experienced handler might not, affecting the subject’s response)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the researchers to identify any factors that might influence the study, and to mitigate for their effects.\nIf we are able to mitigate the effects of nuisance variables, either statistically or by revising the conduct or design of the experiment, then we are more likely to detect the true effect of the variable we are interested in.\n\n\n\nClick on the arrow in the Nuisance variable icon panel, and drag it onto the Analysis node, to link them (Figure 21.11).

This can improve the layout of your diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.5 Link sex to subject allocation\nFor a valid experimental design we must include blocking factors in the randomisation process of adding subjects to experimental groups. This ensures that each individual has an equal chance of receiving each treatment allocated to the block. We need to make sure that this is accounted for in the diagram.\nIn the context of this experiment, we need to ensure that equal numbers of males and females are assigned to the Control (vehicle only) and Treatment (vehicle plus drug A) groups. This is referred to as “randomisation within blocks”: males and females are equally likely to be assigned to either the Control or Treatment groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will need to modify the stated randomisation strategy, to account for how we are randomising individuals to groups, to reflect that we are randomising within blocks.\n\n\n\nClick on the arrow in the Nuisance variable icon panel, and drag it onto the Allocation node, to link them (Figure 21.15). As before,to begin with, this arrow is red, to indicate that we have not specified the kind of relationship between this variable and the allocation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.15: Initial linking of the Sex nuisance variable to the Allocation node.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the arrow, and hover the mouse pointer over the red spanner icon, to see the context menu.

This offers two kinds of relationship: “blocking factor” and “randomised by”\n\n\n\n\nClick on “is blocking factor for” in the context menu, to set the relationship. Like before, the arrow will change format from red, to grey dashes (Figure 21.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.17: The arrow linking the Sex nuisance variable to the Allocation node, after being set as a “blocking factor”.\n\n\n\n\nUse the circles on the “is blocking factor for” linking arrow to reroute the arrow around the “Treatment” Group node, to improve readability (Figure 21.18).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.18: The “blocking factor” arrow can be reshaped by clicking on it and dragging it into a new shape.

    "text": "22.2 Interpreting the suggestions\nThe Analysis Suggestion tool will recommend an approach consistent with the design and information provided, but it may not be completely comprehensive, and the advice might not be exactly right for your situation. The Analysis Suggestion tool does attempt to describe how you should approach the analysis carefully. For example, with this design the result repeats the assumptions it makes about the design and notes:\n\nIf this description is not accurate, please check your diagram and verify that all nodes are connected properly, all variables and variable categories are indicated and tagged to the relevant interventions or measurements and the information provided in the properties of each node is accurate; then critique it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe design tool is not a mind-reader and can only work with the information provided. If that information is incorrect or not accurate about your design, then the suggestion may be incorrect.\n\n\nThe recommendation goes on to list some caveats:\n\nStatistical analysis methods compatible with this design include the one-way ANOVA with blocking factor(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe tool notes that this is only one method compatible with the design, but there are others (including two-way ANOVA, and regression models); just because they are not recommended does not mean they are not appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe ANOVA approach assumes that the data satisfies the parametric assumptions […] If you have reasons to think the data are not normally distributed, […] consider transforming the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that the data collected meet the assumptions of the statistical methods employed. The EDA tool cannot predict what data will be collected.\n\n\n\nNote that a one-way ANOVA can answer the question: is there an overall difference between the groups; they do not provide information on which individual groups differ. To identify where any differences lie, it may be necessary to carry out a post-hoc test. Note that in this case the sample size might have to increase and the experiment should be powered to detect differences in the pairwise comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that the experiment is correctly powered for the comparisons they wish to perform, and that the statistical test is appropriate. For two categories, the one-way ANOVA should require the same sample size as a t-test, for the same statistical power. But if the design and questions become complex, it is usually best to consult a statistician.\n\n\n\nPlease note that an experiment with a single variable of interest might not make the most efficient use of the data. Consider using a factorial design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe EDA tool cannot guess how many other experiments you might want to run, and is trying to be helpful by reminding you to consider this study in the broader scope of your research. A factorial design might make more efficient use of the data collected, and require the use of fewer experimental subjects for the same statistical confidence, if there are multiple factors of interest that could affect the outcome.",

We are interested in a single main comparison involving two groups (control and treatment). We have a further two groups male and female as a blocking factor but, because this is only a blocking factor and not a main comparison, we ignore sex for the purposes of the power calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the power calculation dialogue for the unpaired t-test is selected (as in Figure 23.3).\nDecide on an expected effect size that is biologically relevant. For the purpose of this workshop, let’s assume that we need to see a decrease in blood glucose of at least 2mM/L. Enter the value 2 into the Effect size field.\nDecide on an expected variability in the outcome measure. This is usually determined from previous studies, but here we will assume that variability is 1mM/L, for the sake of the workshop. Enter the value 1 into the Variability field.\nDecide on a significance level for your statistical hypothesis test. This is under researcher control, and we will keep it at 0.05 for the purpose of the workshop.\nDecide on a suitable power (probability of avoiding a false negative error) for the statistical test. This is under researcher control, and power values of 0.8-0.9 are usually acceptable to funders. We will keep this value at 0.9 for the purpose of the workshop.\nDecide whether this will be a one- or two-sided test. As we have specified that we are expecting to see a decrease in blood glucose for a positive outcome, a one-sided t-test is appropriate and will give increased power for the same number of experimental subjects. Set the One or two-sided test field to 1 4 (Figure 23.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.5: The EDA Sample Size Calculation tool dialogue box, populated with values for our power calculation.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Calculate N per group button to have the Sample Size Calculation tool return an estimated sample size for the desired power (?fig-sample-size-5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.6: The Node properties settings for the “Control” Group node, including the estimated sample size, and enough information to enable reproduction of the power calculation.\n\n\n\n\nPopulate the “Treatment” Group node with the recommended number of experimental units, using the Node properties dialogue box.

You’re all scientists and you will have measured things before, so you might think that you should be working with more advanced material - I can sympathise with that. But we’re going to look at measurement in a way that emphasises the role of scientific modelling and explores the idea of sample size and variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Context\n\n\n\nThe example we are using is attempting to answer the question “measure the”What proportion of the Earth’s surface is covered by water?”\nYou probably already have an idea of what proportion that is - about 70%. But pretend that you don’t already know.\nEven if you did already know, have you thought about…\n\nHow accurate is that value of 70%?\nHow would you go about measuring the exact surface area?\n\nAren’t there tides? And coastal erosion? And other things that might affect this?\n\n\nAren’t we really estimating the measurement?\nAnd, if we’re making an estimate, then don’t we need to try to understand how accurate our estimate might be?\n\n\nThis section tries to develop some intuition about measurement, probability, and statistics, from considering that question.",

    "text": "In this section, we will consider the concept of statistical power, and learn how to calculate sample sizes with a widely-used software tool called G*Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Power\n\n\n\nStatistical power is the probability, before a study is performed, that a particular comparison will achieve “statistical significance” at some predetermined level.\nMore precisely, statistical power is the probability that the study will not return a false negative result, known in statistics jargon as a “Type II error”.\n\n\nThere are two decisions we need to make as researchers, if we want to design an experiment to have a certain statistical power:\n\nWhat threshold of statistical significance (p-value, or \\(\\alpha\\)) is appropriate?\nWhat rate of false negative results (“type II errors”) is acceptable to us at that significance level? (i.e. what statistical power do we want?)\n\nThese decisions are in your hands as the researcher although, as we will see, there may be constraints from outside sources, such as funding bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Size\n\n\n\nSample size is the number of experimental units (often, but not always, individuals in this context) used per group in the experiment.\nThe sample size for an experiment involving animals should be informed by a statistical power calculation and chosen such that the experiment is neither underpowered nor overpowered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThere is no universally applicable sample size. An appropriate sample size should be calculated specifically for each experiment.\n\n\nWe can use power calculations to determine appropriate sample sizes. To do this we also need to make additional assumptions (or, if you prefer, “propose hypotheses”) about the future behaviour of data that has not yet been collected:\n\nThe desired effect size (e.g. a change in a value that is biologically meaningful, or a minimum level at which a change of value is recognised to be a change in the system)\nThe variation we expect to see in the measured outcomes (e.g. as a standard deviation)",

    "text": "The Experimental Design Assistant (EDA)\nThe EDA is a web application that can be used in any modern browser. It is intended to help researchers improve the design of animal experiments by making it simple to describe their experiment graphically and in detail, by creating a graphical representation of the experiment, annotated with essential experimental detail. Once created, the graph can be analysed by the tool to make suggestions of suitable statistical analyses, and to identify potential issues with the current design (Karp and Fry (2021)).\nThe tool also provides a number of functions that aid with randomisation and blinding in an experiment, and to help with calculating sample sizes for experimental groups, on the basis of power calculations. To some extent, the EDA system plays the role of a biostatistician, identifying features of the experimental design, and prompting the researcher to include information about their design, in the same way a statistician might.\nThe EDA is a powerful communication tool, allowing researchers rapidly to lay out an unambiguous experimental design, to be shared with other researchers, used in grant and licence applications, or in publications, as publication-quality illustrations.",
