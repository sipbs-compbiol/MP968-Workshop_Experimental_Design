Take a look at the format of the dataset:\nglimpse(penguins)\nYou’ll see there are eight variables, including species, weight, sex, etc. - some of these variables are categorical (i.e. a category, like species), and others are continuous (i.e. numerical). You can see a visual overview of how the data is related using the plot() function:\nplot(penguins)\nWe can visualise the number of penguins of each species in a bar chart:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar()\nfig\nAnd break this down in a facet plot, by sex:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar() +\n         facet_wrap(~sex)\nfig\nWe can make a box and whisker plot of penguin body mass by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=species)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nAnd plot the body mass for each sex side-by-side\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=sex)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nWe can investigate correlations, such as between body mass and flipper length:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nWe can colour datapoints by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nAnd fit a linear regression to each species separately:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point() +\n         geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR comes with a number of example datasets you can practice with, including:\n\nmtcars: fuel consumption and other statistic for 32 automobiles\nTitanic: information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner Titanic\n\nYou can see a full list by running the command\nlibrary(help = \"datasets\")",

So we can answer the question. But what do those numbers represent? What is the scientific insight that is gained? Maybe it’s something like:\n\nthe number of people who vote in an election before and after a bribe is offered\nthe number of mice that survive a condition, after some drug intervention\nreaction times in an individual before and after drinking alcohol\n\nThe point is, we can’t tell what the numbers represent, or what any differences mean, from the data alone! We cannot look at the numbers alone and extract the causes of the data.\n\n“No causes in, no causes out.” - Nancy Cartwright, Cartwright (2011)",

If you believe that reaction times get slower when someone has drunk alcohol, then your causal model is that alcohol consumption causes change in reaction times.\n\n\n\n\nCartwright, Nancy. 2011. “A Philosopher’s View of the Long Road from RCTs to Effectiveness.” Lancet 377 (9775): 1400–1401.",
