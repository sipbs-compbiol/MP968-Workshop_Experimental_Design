    "text": "The reasons for carrying out a statistical analysis are not present in the data\n\n\n\nWhat do we mean by this statement?\nAs an example, consider a statistical question where you have two sets of numbers: {10, 11, 12} and {14, 15, 16}, and you ask: are the averages of these two sets different from each other?\nAs you will recall from your introductory statistics courses, we can always calculate the means and standard deviations of the two sets of numbers, and perform a t-test to calculate a proability that we should reject a null hypothesis of the means being equal. So we can answer the question: “Are the means of these two sets of values statistically different from each other?”.\nBut we’re usually not asking that question in isolation. In an experiment, those numbers represent something in the real world, and in which we’re interested. We want to know what is the scientific insight that is gained? Maybe it’s something like:\n\nthe number of people who vote in an election before and after a bribe is offered\nthe number of mice that survive a condition, after some drug intervention\nreaction times in an individual before and after drinking alcohol\n\nThe point is, we can’t tell what the numbers represent, or what any differences mean, from the data alone! We cannot look at the numbers alone and extract the causes of the data.\n\n“No causes in, no causes out.” - Nancy Cartwright, Cartwright (2011)",

    "section": "What is a causal model?",
    "text": "What is a causal model?\nA causal model is a system where if we change only one variable we will modify some variables in the model. The variable we change is called a cause and the variables that respond suffer the effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation does not imply causation\n\n\n\nYou will probably have correctly heard phrases like “correlation does not imply causation” in reference to the observation that just because you can identify two values apparently changing together, that doesn’t mean that the change in one value causes the other to change. The relationship might be the reverse of what you think (after all, an association between two sets values could run in either direction - the direction is not evident from the data alone), or it may be pure coincidence. There’s even a whole website dedicated to such spurious correlations.\nIt turns out that causation does not imply correlation either, but this is a complex topic that we don’t have time to get into in a single workshop about experimental design.\nThe statment “correlation does not imply causation” is often used dismissively to demean the role of statistics, but that’s unfair. It is possible to estimate causal effects using statistics, but all of the information about causal relationships comes from the researcher.\n\n\nWhen we talk about causes and effects in the context of a statistical association (such as correlation) it is usually intended to mean one of two things:\n\nThe estimate or prediction of the consequences of an intervention - and in an experimental context you are often aiming to set up a system where a single intervention of interest (such as administration of a drug) is being made, and the consequences measured.\nThe imputation of a missing observation - such that, if you have a causal model, you can play “what if?” games by substituting values which you have not directly measured to see what changes in the system might result. This allows us to construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tangible example\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are aware of, or propose, a causal relationship you are expressing the belief that you can predict the consequences of an intervention.\nFor example, if you look out of the window and see trees swaying, and there is some wind, you know the ttwo are connected because the wind is causing the trees to sway, not because the trees are moving and creating the wind. But, if you measured windspeed and tree movement, there would be only a statistical association: there would be nothing in the data itself to tell you which was the cause and which was the effect. But you know the causal relationship and the nature of the intervention: wind makes trees sway. If you climbed into the tree and rocked it, you would not generate wind. But if you measured the amount by which a tree sways, you could make an estimate of the prevailing windspeed.\n\n\n\nAll information about causal relationships comes from the scientists’ understanding of the world or, more to the point, their understanding of the experimental system.\n\nYour beliefs about the system are the causal model\nThe assumptions and beliefs you have that cause you to consider setting up your experiment are a kind of causal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you believe that reaction times get slower when someone has drunk alcohol, then your causal model is that alcohol consumption causes change in reaction times.\n\n\nYou would design your experiment to enable measurements of alcohol consumption and reaction time to be measured, and you might look to find a statistical association. But if you did find a statistical association, your causal interpretation (e.g. that “reaction time slows with increasing alcohol dose”) would be the result of your beliefs about the experimental system, not a result of simply running statistical analysis on the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Experimental design, causal (statistical) inference, and the (statistical) description of a system all depend on the existence of a well-constructed scientific (causal) model.

It is intended to help researchers improve the design of animal experiments by making it simple to describe their experiment graphically and in detail, by creating a directed, acyclic graph (DAG). Once created, the graph can be analysed by the tool to make suggestions of suitable statistical analyses, and to identify potential issues with the current design.\nThe tool also provides a number of functions that aid with randomisation and blinding in an experiment, and to help with calculating sample sizes for experimental groups, on the basis of power calculations. To some extent, the EDA system plays the role of a biostatistician, identifying features of the experimental design, and prompting the researcher to include information about their design, in the same way a statistician might.\nThe EDA is a powerful communication tool, allowing researchers rapidly to lay out an unambiguous experimental design, to be shared with other researchers, used in grant and licence applications, or in publications, as publication-quality illustrations.",
