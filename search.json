    "text": "Correlation does not imply causation\n\n\n\nYou will probably have correctly heard phrases like “correlation does not imply causation” in reference to the observation that just because you can identify two values apparently changing together, that doesn’t mean that the change in one value causes the other to change. The relationship might be the reverse of what you think (after all, an association between two sets values could run in either direction - the direction is not evident from the data alone), or it may be pure coincidence. There’s even a whole website dedicated to such spurious correlations.\nIt turns out that causation does not imply correlation either, but this is a complex topic that we don’t have time to get into in a single workshop about experimental design.\nThe statment “correlation does not imply causation” is often used dismissively to demean the role of statistics, but that’s unfair. It is possible to estimate causal effects using statistics, but all of the information about causal relationships comes from the researcher.\n\n\n\n\nThe estimate or prediction of the consequences of an intervention - and in an experimental context you are often aiming to set up a system where a single intervention of interest (such as administration of a drug) is being made, and the consequences measured.\nThe imputation of a missing observation - such that, if you have a causal model, you can play “what if?” games by substituting values which you have not directly measured to see what changes in the system might result. This allows us to construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tangible example\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are aware of, or propose, a causal relationship you are expressing the belief that you can predict the consequences of an intervention.\nFor example, if you look out of the window and see trees swaying, and there is some wind, you know the ttwo are connected because the wind is causing the trees to sway, not because the trees are moving and creating the wind. But, if you measured windspeed and tree movement, there would be only a statistical association: there would be nothing in the data itself to tell you which was the cause and which was the effect. But you know the causal relationship and the nature of the intervention: wind makes trees sway. If you climbed into the tree and rocked it, you would not generate wind. But if you measured the amount by which a tree sways, you could make an estimate of the prevailing windspeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Your beliefs about the system are the causal model\nThe assumptions and beliefs you have that cause you to consider setting up your experiment are a kind of causal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you believe that reaction times get slower when someone has drunk alcohol, then your causal model is that alcohol consumption causes change in reaction times.\n\n\nYou would design your experiment to enable measurements of alcohol consumption and reaction time to be measured, and you might look to find a statistical association. But if you did find a statistical association, your causal interpretation (e.g. that “reaction time slows with increasing alcohol dose”) would be the result of your beliefs about the experimental system, not a result of simply running statistical analysis on the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Experimental design, causal (statistical) inference, and the (statistical) description of a system all depend on the existence of a well-constructed scientific (causal) model.

Describing your beliefs as a DAG has advantages:\n\nIt is a concise way to express your understanding of the experiment clearly\n\n\nIt is easy to visualise and share with others, so they can understand your view of the experiment\n\n\nThe structure of a DAG can be analysed to suggest an appropriate statistical model\n\n\nA DAG’s structure can suggest which controls to use in an experiment, and what statistical analysis might be most appropriate\nAnalysis of the DAG structure can tell you what can (and what cannot) be logically decided by the experiment, without having to make additional assumptions\n\nWe will introduce DAGs for experimental design in more detail, in the next section.\n\n\n\n\nCartwright, Nancy. 2011. “A Philosopher’s View of the Long Road from RCTs to Effectiveness.” Lancet 377 (9775): 1400–1401.",

    "section": "5.2 Causal relationships in our experiment",
    "text": "5.2 Causal relationships in our experiment\nFor the experiment we are building in our EDA example, we assume that the outcome variable, plasma glucose level, is potentially dependent on three causal relationships:\n\nthe pharmacological effect of drug A\nthe pharmacological effect of the vehicle\nindividual differences between experimental subjects (mice)\n\nand we have structured our experiment accordingly:\n\n5.2.1 The pharmacological effect of drug A: treatment vs no treatment\nThe causal influence of administering drug A (or not) on the plasma glucose levels of our experimental subjects is the central reason for performing this experiment. Naturally then, we would want to compare what happens to plasma glucose levels when we intervene with drug A, and when we do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn statistical terms, the presence or absence of drug A is our independent variable or explanatory variable.\nWhether drug A is administered or not is entirely under our control, as experimenters.\n\n\nThere are several ways to structure such a comparison, but this research question naturally suggests the use of two experimental groups: one receiving drug A, and one not. We can assume that the results for these groups are each representative of a much larger population, for which the effect of introducing drug A (or not) follows the shape of a parametrisable statistical distribution, like a Normal distribution.\n\n\n5.2.2 Control vs treatment groups\nUnfortunately, we cannot administer the drug in isolation. Drug A, like most drugs, is carried in a vehicle - a substance expected to be inert in the context of the treatment.\nIt would be possible, but unwise, to assume that we could administer drug A alone to one group of mice, and apply no intervention to the other. We are measuring a physiological response which might be affected by many other processes, including the individual being subject to an injection. It might not be correct to assume that the vehicle is inert, either. So we must follow the same protocol as closely as possible in a control group, where the only difference under our control between control and treatment is the presence or absence of drug A.\nPractically then, in our experiment we use two pharmacological interventions:\n\ninjection of a vehicle (control)\ninjection of a vehicle containing drug A (treatment)\n\nWe assume that any variation between individual vehicle preparations (or the experimental subjects’ responses to them) are effectively “drawn from the same population,” and that both groups experience the same causal influence from the injection process, and the introduction of the vehicle. As a consequence we assume that any observed difference between the groups is the result of either receiving drug A, or not receiving it.\n\n\n5.2.3 Random assignment of individuals to groups\nThe remaining potential causal influence we consider - that due to underlying differences between individuals - is accounted for inour experimental design by randomising subjects into experimental groups (treatment and control, see Chapter 8).\nThis works because we assume that all individuals are “drawn from the same population,” such that each mouse as a random choice from a single pool whose underlying plasma glucose level is distributed according to some kind of regular (potentially parametrisable) statistical distribution. This is usually a reasonable assumption, and implies that the groups are samples from the same larger population, so should have similar properties\nThe important consequence of this is that we can argue that - before we intervene with the experimental treatments - we should expect the underlying plasma distribution levels of our treatment and control groups to be comparable. Any differences in measured outcome should then be expected to derive only from our experimental interventions and, in particular, only from the presence or absence of drug A.",

    "text": "The Experimental Design Assistant (EDA)\nThe EDA is a web application that can be used in any modern browseer. It is intended to help researchers improve the design of animal experiments by making it simple to describe their experiment graphically and in detail, by creating a directed, acyclic graph (DAG). Once created, the graph can be analysed by the tool to make suggestions of suitable statistical analyses, and to identify potential issues with the current design.\nThe tool also provides a number of functions that aid with randomisation and blinding in an experiment, and to help with calculating sample sizes for experimental groups, on the basis of power calculations. To some extent, the EDA system plays the role of a biostatistician, identifying features of the experimental design, and prompting the researcher to include information about their design, in the same way a statistician might.\nThe EDA is a powerful communication tool, allowing researchers rapidly to lay out an unambiguous experimental design, to be shared with other researchers, used in grant and licence applications, or in publications, as publication-quality illustrations.",
