We preload this data in the setup cell (see source code), and you can interact with it below with the code:\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"reporter_curves.csv\")\nglimpse(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate Palmer’s Penguins\n\n\n\n\n\nThe penguins dataset contains data about three different species of penguins. Take a look at the format of the dataset:\nglimpse(penguins)\nYou’ll see there are eight variables, including species, weight, sex, etc. - some of these variables are categorical (i.e. a category, like species), and others are continuous (i.e. numerical). You can see a visual overview of how the data is related using the plot() function:\nplot(penguins)\nWe can visualise the number of penguins of each species in a bar chart:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar()\nfig\nAnd break this down in a facet plot, by sex:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar() +\n         facet_wrap(~sex)\nfig\nWe can make a box and whisker plot of penguin body mass by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=species)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nAnd plot the body mass for each sex side-by-side\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=sex)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nWe can investigate correlations, such as between body mass and flipper length:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nWe can colour datapoints by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nAnd fit a linear regression to each species separately:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point() +\n         geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR comes with a number of example datasets you can practice with, including:\n\nmtcars: fuel consumption and other statistic for 32 automobiles\nTitanic: information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner Titanic\n\nYou can see a full list by running the command\nlibrary(help = \"datasets\")",
