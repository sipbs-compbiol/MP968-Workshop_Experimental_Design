    "text": "Correlation does not imply causation\n\n\n\nYou will probably have correctly heard phrases like “correlation does not imply causation” in reference to the observation that just because you can identify two values apparently changing together, that doesn’t mean that the change in one value causes the other to change. The relationship might be the reverse of what you think (after all, an association between two sets values could run in either direction - the direction is not evident from the data alone), or it may be pure coincidence. There’s even a whole website dedicated to such spurious correlations.\nIt turns out that causation does not imply correlation either, but this is a complex topic that we don’t have time to get into in a single workshop about experimental design.\nThe statment “correlation does not imply causation” is often used dismissively to demean the role of statistics, but that’s unfair. It is possible to estimate causal effects using statistics, but all of the information about causal relationships comes from the researcher.\n\n\n\n\nThe estimate or prediction of the consequences of an intervention - and in an experimental context you are often aiming to set up a system where a single intervention of interest (such as administration of a drug) is being made, and the consequences measured.\nThe imputation of a missing observation - such that, if you have a causal model, you can play “what if?” games by substituting values which you have not directly measured to see what changes in the system might result. This allows us to construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tangible example\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are aware of, or propose, a causal relationship you are expressing the belief that you can predict the consequences of an intervention.\nFor example, if you look out of the window and see trees swaying, and there is some wind, you know the ttwo are connected because the wind is causing the trees to sway, not because the trees are moving and creating the wind. But, if you measured windspeed and tree movement, there would be only a statistical association: there would be nothing in the data itself to tell you which was the cause and which was the effect. But you know the causal relationship and the nature of the intervention: wind makes trees sway. If you climbed into the tree and rocked it, you would not generate wind. But if you measured the amount by which a tree sways, you could make an estimate of the prevailing windspeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Your beliefs about the system are the causal model\nThe assumptions and beliefs you have that cause you to consider setting up your experiment are a kind of causal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you believe that reaction times get slower when someone has drunk alcohol, then your causal model is that alcohol consumption causes change in reaction times.\n\n\nYou would design your experiment to enable measurements of alcohol consumption and reaction time to be measured, and you might look to find a statistical association. But if you did find a statistical association, your causal interpretation (e.g. that “reaction time slows with increasing alcohol dose”) would be the result of your beliefs about the experimental system, not a result of simply running statistical analysis on the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Experimental design, causal (statistical) inference, and the (statistical) description of a system all depend on the existence of a well-constructed scientific (causal) model.

Describing your beliefs as a DAG has advantages:\n\nIt is a concise way to express your understanding of the experiment clearly\n\n\nIt is easy to visualise and share with others, so they can understand your view of the experiment\n\n\nThe structure of a DAG can be analysed to suggest an appropriate statistical model\n\n\nA DAG’s structure can suggest which controls to use in an experiment, and what statistical analysis might be most appropriate\nAnalysis of the DAG structure can tell you what can (and what cannot) be logically decided by the experiment, without having to make additional assumptions\n\nWe will introduce DAGs for experimental design in more detail, in the next section.\n\n\n\n\nCartwright, Nancy. 2011. “A Philosopher’s View of the Long Road from RCTs to Effectiveness.” Lancet 377 (9775): 1400–1401.",

    "section": "6.2 Causal relationships in our experiment",
    "text": "6.2 Causal relationships in our experiment\nFor the experiment we are building in our EDA example, we assume that the outcome variable, plasma glucose level, is potentially dependent on three causal relationships:\n\nthe pharmacological effect of drug A\nthe pharmacological effect of the vehicle\nindividual differences between experimental subjects (mice)\n\nand we have structured our experiment accordingly:\n\n6.2.1 The pharmacological effect of drug A: treatment vs no treatment\nThe causal influence of administering drug A (or not) on the plasma glucose levels of our experimental subjects is the central reason for performing this experiment. Naturally then, we would want to compare what happens to plasma glucose levels when we intervene with drug A, and when we do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn statistical terms, the presence or absence of drug A is our independent variable or explanatory variable.\nWhether drug A is administered or not is entirely under our control, as experimenters.\n\n\nThere are several ways to structure such a comparison, but this research question naturally suggests the use of two experimental groups: one receiving drug A, and one not. We can assume that the results for these groups are each representative of a much larger population, for which the effect of introducing drug A (or not) follows the shape of a parametrisable statistical distribution, like a Normal distribution.\n\n\n6.2.2 Control vs treatment groups\nUnfortunately, we cannot administer the drug in isolation. Drug A, like most drugs, is carried in a vehicle - a substance expected to be inert in the context of the treatment.\nIt would be possible, but unwise, to assume that we could administer drug A alone to one group of mice, and apply no intervention to the other. We are measuring a physiological response which might be affected by many other processes, including the individual being subject to an injection. It might not be correct to assume that the vehicle is inert, either. So we must follow the same protocol as closely as possible in a control group, where the only difference under our control between control and treatment is the presence or absence of drug A.\nPractically then, in our experiment we use two pharmacological interventions:\n\ninjection of a vehicle (control)\ninjection of a vehicle containing drug A (treatment)\n\nWe assume that any variation between individual vehicle preparations (or the experimental subjects’ responses to them) are effectively “drawn from the same population,” and that both groups experience the same causal influence from the injection process, and the introduction of the vehicle. As a consequence we assume that any observed difference between the groups is the result of either receiving drug A, or not receiving it.\n\n\n6.2.3 Random assignment of individuals to groups\nThe remaining potential causal influence we consider - that due to underlying differences between individuals - is accounted for inour experimental design by randomising subjects into experimental groups (treatment and control, see Chapter 9).\nThis works because we assume that all individuals are “drawn from the same population,” such that each mouse as a random choice from a single pool whose underlying plasma glucose level is distributed according to some kind of regular (potentially parametrisable) statistical distribution. This is usually a reasonable assumption, and implies that the groups are samples from the same larger population, so should have similar properties\nThe important consequence of this is that we can argue that - before we intervene with the experimental treatments - we should expect the underlying plasma distribution levels of our treatment and control groups to be comparable. Any differences in measured outcome should then be expected to derive only from our experimental interventions and, in particular, only from the presence or absence of drug A.",

Our simple design might be a bit more complicated than we think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Our experimental design isn’t as good as we think it is!\n\n\n\n\nClick on the OK button\nNote the locations and kinds of feedback the Critique tool provided (Figure 11.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: The EDA critique output highlights errors with a red box, warnings with an amber box, and advice with a blue box. There are errors in our Experiment node, in the control and treatment Group nodes, and in our Outcome measure node. There are warnings all over the experimental design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors and Warnings: What should we fix?\n\n\n\nThe EDA Critique tool reports three kinds of issue:\n\nErrors are critical problems with the design that would prevent the tool from being able to decide upon an appropriate statistical analysis, or that would indicate structural problems with the design, such as missing or inappropriate elements, that would compromise the experiment fatally. Errors will block further analysis of the experimental design.\nWarnings are generally about missing information that, while not compromising the experiment to the point that it just won’t work, may result in inappropriate analyses. A typical example of this is when the design does not take experimental subject sex into account, this is raised as a warning. Working with a single sex can be justified (e.g. prostate cancer research, breast cancer research) but in general is not good practice and can compromise the interpretation or applicability of results. Warnings typically highlight where clarification could alter the analysis method or interpretation.\nAdvice labels are similar to warnings in that they highlight ambiguities or areas where unstated decisions might alter the conduct or interpretation of the experiment. They are typically less severe than warnings.\n\nErrors must be fixed for the experimental design to be considered at all usable. Issues flagged as warnings or advice notices need not be fixed, as the choices made may be justified. However, it is always worthwhile inspecting the warnings, as attending to them may help clarify and improve the design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt can help to have a strategy to approach dealing with Critique tool output. Two principles might help resolve issues more efficiently.\n\nDeal with errors first, then warnings, then advice\nIssues in the Experiment node might affect other nodes in the experiment, so attend to these first.\nIssues in nodes “early” in the experiment (e.g. in defining experimental groups) might affect nodes “downstream” in the experiment, so work from defining your groups through to the analysis step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOn this page we will deal only with the highlighted errors. Later in the workshop we will handle an implication of one of the warnings.",

These errors would be expected to affect the whole experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe bold text in the error dialogue box provides links to help text and advice about resolving each specific error, and what options are available to you.\n\n\n\n11.3.1 Resolve the “experimental unit” error\n\nClick on the OK button to close the dialogue box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental units\n\n\n\n\n\nAn experimental unit is the subject that is exposed to an intervention, in the course of the experiment, independently of other experimental units. Most of the time in in vivo research the experimental unit is a single animal, but it might in some cases be a group of animals, part of an animal (if you are testing distinct limbs of the same animal, for instance), or the same animal at different periods of time.\nThe sample size of an experiment is the number of experimental units in each group. It is critical for good statistics, and being able to make an appropriate inference from your experiment, that the experimental unit is well defined.\nIn the workshop experiment, we are taking a systemic measurement of blood glucose from each animal at the endpoint of the experiment, so our experimental unit is the animal.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new Experimental unit node, by clicking on the grey lozenge in the Pool Group node’s icon menu (Figure 11.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: The grey lozenge icon in the Group node panel creates a new Experimental unit node.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the new node into a clear space, and click on the properties icon to bring up the Node properties pane (Figure 11.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: The Experimental unit node field panel\n\n\n\n\nRename the node in the label field as “Animal” and select “animal” from the experimental unit is drop-down (Figure 11.8).

Other terms for the same thing include parameter, predictor, or factor of interest.\nHere, our independent variable of interest is drug A, as we are testing the response of animals in the presence or absence of the drug, and the administration of the drug is under the experimenter’s control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo add an independent variable of interest to our design, we need to introduce two new node types:\n\nAn Independent variable of interest node, which states what the variable itself is (e.g. dosage, surgery, drug)\nTwo Variable category nodes, because our variable is categorical - it is subdivided into two categories: “vehicle only”, and “vehicle + drug”.\n\n\n\n\nDrag an Independent variable of interest node from the sidebar on the left, onto the canvas. Double-click on the node, and rename it as “Drug A” (Figure 11.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: A new Independent variable of interest node, renamed as “Drug A”. This represents a variable that describes whether drug A was administered or not.\n\n\n\n\nUse the green lozenge icon in the Drug A Independent variable node you just made to create two Variable category nodes, linked to the independent variable (Figure 11.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Clicking on the green lozenge icon twice creates two new Variable category nodes, which describe the categories that the “Drug A” variable may belong to.\n\n\n\n\nRename the Variable category nodes as “vehicle” and “vehicle + drug” (Figure 11.11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.11: The Variable category nodes are named “vehicle” and “vehicle + drug” to represent the two categories for the “Drug A” variable.\n\n\n\n\nLink the “Drug A” variable to the Analysis node by dragging the arrow icon from the “Drug A” node icon panel onto the Analysis node (Figure 11.12). This adds an arrow to the diagram indicating that “Drug A” is a factor of interest for the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.12: The “Drug A” variable is linked to the Analysis node as a factor of interest.",

This is particularly a concern of the Medical Research Council (MRC), which funds medical research in the UK. Failure to account for sex in experimental design may lead to a study not being funded.\nOf particular importance in animal studies is the requirement for both sexes to be used in experimental design.\nIt is still possible to obtain funding from the MRC for single-sex studies, but only where there is strong justification for doing so.

    "text": "MRC’s “Embedding diversity in research design”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis applies to all animal, cell, tissue, and human participant research.\nCategories to be considered include sex, gender, ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and disability.\n\n\n\n\nMRC’s “Sex in experimental design”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRC Policy on Sex in Experimental Design\n\n\n\nMRC requires applicants to embed diversity in the design of their studies (see MRC’s policy on embedding diversity in research design). This includes the requirement for both sexes to be used in the experimental design of grant applications involving animals, and human and animal tissues and cells, unless there is a strong justification for not doing so.\nWe also expect applications to include information about the sex of the animals used in experiments, as well as the sex of studied tissues and cells. If you don’t know the sex of the cells and tissues you use, you should plan to determine it as part of your research.\nUse of both sexes is the default\n\n\n\n\nwhere there are acutely scarce resources (for example, human tissue samples of rare diseases)\nresearch into the mechanisms of purely molecular interactions (for example, when investigating protein-protein interactions)\nsingle-sex mechanisms or diseases (for example, ovarian cancer)\nlogistical or ethical considerations with robust justification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnacceptable justifications\n\n\n\nAttempted justifications for single-sex designs that the MRC considers to be insufficient include:\n\nfemale variability (in most cases)\nprior work was performed in only one sex\na lack of evidence of sex having an effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing no-one tells you\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted in Chapter 11, even experienced scientists with many publications and long track records of research funding may never have received any formal training in experimental design. This can lead to entrenched and outdated ideas being propagated, such as that it is not necessary to use both sexes in an experiment because it was previously shown that there is no effect due to sex 2.\nUltimately, as a researcher you are responsible for the rigour and ethics of your own actions. It is always advisable to consult with funding bodies and specialists in research ethics, rather than trust the word of senior scientists alone.\n\n\n\n\n12.1.1 Common statistical misunderstandings\nIt is still possible to hear scientists argue that they should not use both sexes in their experimental design, because it would double the number of animals required, and this would go against the 3Rs principles. A 2021 study also found:\n\nUsing a list of […] published articles […] we examined reports of sex differences and non-differences across nine biological disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the 147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence supporting those differences was often missing. For example, when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed, authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and males responded differently.\n\nand called for further efforts to “train researchers how to test for and report sex differences in order to promote rigour and reproducibility in biomedical research” (Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney (2021)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another thing no-one tells you\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to experimental design, it is possible that even experienced scientists with many publications and long track records of research funding may never have received any formal training in statistics. 3\nAgain, as a researcher you are responsible for the rigour and ethics of your own actions. It is always advisable to consult with statisticians, rather than trust the word of senior scientists alone.\n\n\n\nChanging the design of an experiment from single-sex to two sexes typically does not require an increase in the number of individuals studied. It can often be achieved by running the same experiment but changing half the animals to the opposite sex (e.g. a study designed with 8 males becomes a study with 4 males and 4 females), and analysing the results using ANOVA instead of a t-test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring sex differences\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason the common misunderstanding that animal numbers need to be doubled arises is because researchers don’t immediately realise that sex can be considered as a blocking factor (also known as a nuisance variable), rather than a main effect of study.\nThis is important because, when we estimate the count of sample size needed by power calculation, we are considering the number of individuals required to establish a result only for main effects. We do not need to power experiments for a statistical difference in nuisance variables. Consequently, if the main effects (independent variables of interest, in EDA) remain the same, the number of individuals required to power the experiment remains the same.\nConsidering sex as a blocking factor in this way is known as “monitoring for a difference in sex.” We do not have differences between sexes as a focus of our study, but we would like to be in a position to notice, if there is a large difference between the sexes.",

Clearly, sex is one such factor (the response of an individual animal may vary depending on whether the animal is male or female), but we should always take care to identify and mitigate for any such sources of variability, in the way we conduct our experiments. Some possible blocking factors might include:\n\nthe cage or room that individuals are housed in (there may be differences between locales that influence outcome)\nthe time of day that measurements are made (animals may be diurnal, and respond differently in the morning and evening)\nthe experimenter or handler’s identity (an inexperienced handler may cause stress in animals, and an experienced handler might not, affecting the subject’s response)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the researchers to identify any factors that might influence the study, and to mitigate for their effects.\nIf we are able to mitigate the effects of nuisance variables, either statistically or by revising the conduct or design of the experiment, then we are more likely to detect the true effect of the variable we are interested in.\n\n\n\nClick on the arrow in the Nuisance variable icon panel, and drag it onto the Analysis node, to link them (Figure 12.11).

This ensures that each individual has an equal chance of receiving each treatment allocated to the block. We need to make sure that this is accounted for in the diagram.\nIn the context of this experiment, we need to ensure that equal numbers of males and females are assigned to the Control (vehicle only) and Treatment (vehicle plus drug A) groups. This is referred to as “randomisation within blocks”: males and females are equally likely to be assigned to either the Control or Treatment groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will need to modify the stated randomisation strategy, to account for how we are randomising individuals to groups, to reflect that we are randomising within blocks.\n\n\n\nClick on the arrow in the Nuisance variable icon panel, and drag it onto the Allocation node, to link them (Figure 12.15).

    "text": "13.2 Interpreting the suggestions\nThe Analysis Suggestion tool will recommend an approach consistent with the design and information provided, but it may not be completely comprehensive, and the advice might not be exactly right for your situation. The Analysis Suggestion tool does attempt to describe how you should approach the analysis carefully. For example, with this design the result repeats the assumptions it makes about the design and notes:\n\nIf this description is not accurate, please check your diagram and verify that all nodes are connected properly, all variables and variable categories are indicated and tagged to the relevant interventions or measurements and the information provided in the properties of each node is accurate; then critique it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe design tool is not a mind-reader and can only work with the information provided. If that information is incorrect or not accurate about your design, then the suggestion may be incorrect.\n\n\nThe recommendation goes on to list some caveats:\n\nStatistical analysis methods compatible with this design include the one-way ANOVA with blocking factor(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe tool notes that this is only one method compatible with the design, but there are others (including two-way ANOVA, and regression models); just because they are not recommended does not mean they are not appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe ANOVA approach assumes that the data satisfies the parametric assumptions […] If you have reasons to think the data are not normally distributed, […] consider transforming the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that the data collected meet the assumptions of the statistical methods employed. The EDA tool cannot predict what data will be collected.\n\n\n\nNote that a one-way ANOVA can answer the question: is there an overall difference between the groups; they do not provide information on which individual groups differ. To identify where any differences lie, it may be necessary to carry out a post-hoc test. Note that in this case the sample size might have to increase and the experiment should be powered to detect differences in the pairwise comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that the experiment is correctly powered for the comparisons they wish to perform, and that the statistical test is appropriate. For two categories, the one-way ANOVA should require the same sample size as a t-test, for the same statistical power. But if the design and questions become complex, it is usually best to consult a statistician.\n\n\n\nPlease note that an experiment with a single variable of interest might not make the most efficient use of the data. Consider using a factorial design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe EDA tool cannot guess how many other experiments you might want to run, and is trying to be helpful by reminding you to consider this study in the broader scope of your research. A factorial design might make more efficient use of the data collected, and require the use of fewer experimental subjects for the same statistical confidence, if there are multiple factors of interest that could affect the outcome.",

Enter the value 2 into the Effect size field.\nDecide on an expected variability in the outcome measure. This is usually determined from previous studies, but here we will assume that variability is 1mM/L, for the sake of the workshop. Enter the value 1 into the Variability field.\nDecide on a significance level for your statistical hypothesis test. This is under researcher control, and we will keep it at 0.05 for the purpose of the workshop.\nDecide on a suitable power (probability of avoiding a false negative error) for the statistical test. This is under researcher control, and power values of 0.8-0.9 are usually acceptable to funders. We will keep this value at 0.9 for the purpose of the workshop.\nDecide whether this will be a one- or two-sided test. As we have specified that we are expecting to see a decrease in blood glucose for a positive outcome, a one-sided t-test is appropriate and will give increased power for the same number of experimental subjects. Set the One or two-sided test field to 1 4 (Figure 14.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.5: The EDA Sample Size Calculation tool dialogue box, populated with values for our power calculation.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Calculate N per group button to have the Sample Size Calculation tool return an estimated sample size for the desired power (?fig-sample-size-5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.6: The Node properties settings for the “Control” Group node, including the estimated sample size, and enough information to enable reproduction of the power calculation.\n\n\n\n\nPopulate the “Treatment” Group node with the recommended number of experimental units, using the Node properties dialogue box.

Once created, the graph can be analysed by the tool to make suggestions of suitable statistical analyses, and to identify potential issues with the current design (Karp and Fry (2021)).\nThe tool also provides a number of functions that aid with randomisation and blinding in an experiment, and to help with calculating sample sizes for experimental groups, on the basis of power calculations. To some extent, the EDA system plays the role of a biostatistician, identifying features of the experimental design, and prompting the researcher to include information about their design, in the same way a statistician might.\nThe EDA is a powerful communication tool, allowing researchers rapidly to lay out an unambiguous experimental design, to be shared with other researchers, used in grant and licence applications, or in publications, as publication-quality illustrations.",

    "text": "Underpowered studies\nWe sometimes refer to studies as being “low-powered” or “underpowered.” This means that the expected effect size is small in relation to the variation (e.g. standard error) of the measurement. Low power in studies might result from having too few experimental units (e.g. individual subjects), or from measurements having relatively high variability due to the effect of noisy nuisance variables.\nUnderpowered studies may not give a statistically significant result even when a relatively large effect is found in the experiment. Worse still, because a very large effect may be required to reach statistical significance, such a result is likely to be a statistical outlier and not reflect the true effect size.\nFigure 1: When effect size is small compared to the standard error of the measurement, statistical power is low, and the study is underpowered. In this figure, the null hypothesis is that there is no effect. The real effect size is assumed to be 2% of the size of the control, and estimates are assumed to have the same standard error as the control experiment. The curve represents the distribution of possible estimates of effect size as a Normal distribution with \\(\\mu=2\\%, \\sigma=10\\%\\). Statistical significance is unlikely to be achieved but, if it is achieved, it is misleading, as there is a reasonable chance (39%) that the significant result will be in the wrong direction and, in any case, the magnitude of the effect size will be greatly overestimated.

We may then be concerned with the cost of conducting the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe primary cost of an experiment involving animals is ethical, and measured in the potential for animal suffering. The financial cost is a secondary consideration. Funders will typically fund the experiment most likely to give robust useful results in an ethical manner, not the cheapest experiment possible.\nAs stated in the NC3Rs EDA guide,\n\nUnder-powered in vivo experiments waste time and resources, lead to unnecessary animal suffering and result in erroneous biological conclusions.\n\nSimilarly, over-powered experiments in which more animals than necessary are used to establish a result also lead to unnecessary animal suffering and are unethical.\n\nEthically, when working with animals we need to conduct a harm–benefit analysis to ensure the animal use is justified for the scientific gain. Experiments should be robust, not use more or fewer animals than necessary, and truly add to the knowledge base of science.

    "text": "Practical consequences of statistical power\nConsidering statistical power for an experiment suggests some general approaches to improve our chances, as researchers, of seeing a statistically significant result when there is a real effect of suitable size. It also has implications about what kinds of results we are likely to find in the literature, and how we should interpret them.\n\nIt is generally better to double the effect size than to double sample size\nThe standard error of estimation decreases with the square of sample size 1. So, if we double our sample size we should expect, approximately, a \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.4\\times\\) reduction in standard error. But if we are able to double the effect size then the actual difference we are trying to measure would be \\(2\\times\\) as large, and this will have a greater effect on the power of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to maximise effect size, including:\n\nsetting doses as low as ethically possible in the control group, and as high as ethically possible in the treeatment group.\nchoosing individuals that are especially likely to respond to the treatment\n\n\n\nDesigning an experiment with the aim of increasing effect size can be difficult, and lead to other issues. When treatments are set to extreme values it can make the interpretation of the results when treatments are applied at more realistic levels doubtful. If a highly sensitive set of individuals is used, then the results may not generalise across the wider population.\nIt is for the researcher to decide and justify whether conclusive effects on a subgroup are preferred to inconclusive but more generalisable results.\n\n\nThe Winner’s Curse\nThere is a concept in economics called the “Winner’s Curse” in which the winning bidder of an auction is likely to have overpaid with respect to the value of the item being auctioned.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that, by focusing on “statistically significant” results, we generate a systematically biased, overoptimistic picture of the world. In Figure 1, we have results corresponding to a study where the true effect size could not realistically be more than 2%, but is estimated with a standard error of 10%. The curve shows the distribution of experimental estimates we would expect, shading in green those areas where the result is at least \\(1.96\\sigma\\) from the null hypothesis, i.e. “statistically significant.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUsing the properties of the Normal distribution we can calculate that 5.4% of the estimates will be considered to be “statistically significant”, and that 39% of the time the “statistically significant” difference will be a reduction in effect - a change in the wrong direction!\n\n\nWe can say, without performing any experiment, that a study with these properties has essentially no chance of providing useful information.\n\n\nPublished results tend to be positive, and overestimates\nDue to the effects of the “winner’s curse,” and well-intentioned designs that attempt to maximise effect size, it is likely that actual effects are smaller in a general population than in any specific study.\nAlso, due to the systematic bias that “positive” (i.e. “statistically significant”) results tend to be published when “negative” (i.e. “not significant”) results are not, publication typically biases towards “statistically significant” results whose measured effect sizes, as seen from the “winner’s curse,” are likely to be larger than would be seen in the general population.\n\n\n\n\nKarp, Natasha A, and Derek Fry. 2021. “What Is the Optimum Design for My Animal Experiment?” BMJ Open Sci. 5 (1): e100126.",
